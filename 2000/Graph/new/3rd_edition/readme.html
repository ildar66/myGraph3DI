<h2>Exercise Workbooks and Examples</h2>

<p>
Although EJB applications themselves are portable, the manner in which
you install and run EJB products varies widely from one vendor to the
next. For this reason it is nearly impossible to cover all the EJB
products available, so we have chosen a radical but effective way to
address these differences: workbooks.
</p>

<p>
Each workbook is a server-specific companion to the third edition of
Richard Monson-Haefel's best-selling and award-winning <i>Enterprise
JavaBeans</i> (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 2001). It guides you step by step 
through the exercises called out in the 3rd edition, explains how to build and
deploy working solutions in a particular application server, and
provides useful hints, tips, and warnings.
</p>

<p>
These workbooks are published by Titan Books in the context of a
friendly agreement with O'Reilly &amp; Associates, the publishers of
<i>Enterprise JavaBeans</i>, to provide serious developers with the best
possible foundation for success in EJB development on their chosen
platforms. You can download these workbooks for free in PDF format from
this Web site, or you can purchase the paper editions from Titan Books,
Inc. at
